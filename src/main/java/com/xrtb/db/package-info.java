 * Contains a very simple database structure, as a hashmap, for use with the administration portal
 * The intent is to be as simple as possible. A commercial implementation would have a lot more
 * capability but for a prototype, we just need a simple setup. The idea is to store the database of
 * users and their campaigns as a JSON file.
